This is no surprise as the second order Runge-Kutta method was always meant to be better than the other two, and the Euler-Cromer was naturally meant to be an improvement upon the Euler method. In particular, the Runge-Kutta method is the winner because of how it attempts to mitigate error; by taking an average over an interval, it dramatically reduces the effects of sudden changes in position/velocity. The Runge-Kutta method also does a superior job of conserving energy, though it is notable that none of the methods truly conserve energy (especially not the Euler method!). This is perhaps the only flaw of solving problems through computational methods.

Namely, if the pendulum bobs back and forth, we get a circle- but if the pendulum has sufficient velocity to spin continuously, we get more of a parabolic shape. This gives us a way of examining the relationship between how fast the pendulum's initial velocity must have been and its initial angle. For example, in the case of the pendulum bobbing back and forth, we get a circular result; we can interpret it to mean that when the angular velocity is zero the angular displacement will be at a maximum amplitude, which is exactly right."
